				<p>Today is my last day at Codagami. It’s been almost exactly 3 years since I started, and I can’t say enough about how much I’ve learned and grown over those three years. I’m moving on for a multitude of reasons - some bigger than others and some smaller. But most importantly I’m moving on to continue growing and challenging myself in new directions.</p>
<h2 id="The_Details">The Details</h2><p>First, I’m leaving because eventually I’ll be starting a new position with our local community college, <a href="http://www.parkland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Parkland College</a> as an instructor in their Computer Science and Information Technology department. I’m taking this position because I’ve always loved the teaching experiences I’ve had with any role I’ve been in and I’ve wanted to get closer to that area with my career moves than further. I’ll start by teaching a summer course or two and then begin full-time teaching in the fall.</p>
<p>As part of the new role I’ll be taking with Parkland, I am being given the opportunity to help coordinate some major updates to their software development curriculum and programs. I realize this will be a lot of work, but at the end of the day I am pretty stoked about the idea that I’ll be able to apply my industry experience into the degree programs we’ll be offering. The challenge of trying to build an ever-evolving curriculum that keeps up with an industry that changes as quickly as ours is definitely not going to be easy - but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized those are the types of challenges that make me want to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>So, you might be wondering… what on earth am I going to be doing between now and the fall (and the future summers for that matter)? Well - I’ll be working for myself.  This actually supplements my new role quite well, as staying in-tune with the industry from both a technical and relationship level will continue to give me that <em>“real-world”</em> experience I’ll need as I work with students and develop curriculum.</p>
<p>I’m actively looking for and taking on small projects here and there to keep myself busy and stay as knee-deep in the software development industry as I can. I’ve got some work lined up currently and will continue to try to seek out cool projects that I can learn from (if you have any - please feel free to reach out). I will be setting up a business entity and doing all that sorts of stuff over the next few weeks - so stay tuned.</p>

But most importantly I\'m moving on to continue growing and challenging myself in new directions.\n\n##The Details##\nFirst, I\'m leaving because eventually I\'ll be starting a new position with our local community college, [Parkland College](http://www.parkland.edu/) as an instructor in their Computer Science and Information Technology department. I\'m taking this position because I\'ve always loved the teaching experiences I\'ve had with any role I\'ve been in and I\'ve wanted to get closer to that area with my career moves than further. I\'ll start by teaching a summer course or two and then begin full-time teaching in the fall.\n\nAs part of the new role I\'ll be taking with Parkland, I am being given the opportunity to help coordinate some major updates to their software development curriculum and programs. I realize this will be a lot of work, but at the end of the day I am pretty stoked about the idea that I\'ll be able to apply my industry experience into the degree programs we\'ll be offering. The challenge of trying to build an ever-evolving curriculum that keeps up with an industry that changes as quickly as ours is definitely not going to be easy - but as I\'ve gotten older I\'ve realized those are the types of challenges that make me want to get up in the morning.\n\nSo, you might be wondering... what on earth am I going to be doing between now and the fall (and the future summers for that matter)? Well - I\'ll be working for myself.  This actually supplements my new role quite well, as staying in-tune with the industry from both a technical and relationship level will continue to give me that *"real-world"* experience I\'ll need as I work with students and develop curriculum.\n\nI\'m actively looking for and taking on small projects here and there to keep myself busy and stay as knee-deep in the software development industry as I can.

      { title: 'Debugging Elmah on Azure',
        subtitle: 'What do you do when the error handler is erroring...',
        date: [Object],
        _content: '\nRecently I was deploying an application to the new Azure Websites service, and I noticed a slight problem with my app.\n\nELMAH worked on my machine, but not in the cloud.\n\nNeedless to say, if your exception logging isn\'t working, then you\'re probably not going to sleep well at night. So my first question, naturally, was "How in the world do I see what is going on inside ELMAH?".\n\nOne thing that many folks don\'t realize until they need to do something like this is that logging libraries tend to "eat" many of their internal exceptions since they are usually the layer that is added to take care of exactly that. I say they "eat" their exceptions not in a strict sense, but more so because there really is no where you can do a "TRY CATCH" to see what is happening.\n\n##Tracing to the Rescue\n\nInstead of throwing exceptions both ELMAH and Log4net output their exceptions to the System.Diagnostics.Trace object. This is sweet when debugging locally, as any application traces will automatically write to the Output window in Visual Studio. But as the title of this post reads, that doesn\'t help me at all.\n\nI needed to figure out how to output the traces of my app running in Azure to some storage that I could then view. I did have Log4net working, and it was writing to an SQL Azure database, so I decided to go with that option.\n\nFirst, I had to learn a few things about ASP.NET and Tracing. ASP.NET has its own tracing mechanism that is somewhat separate from the Diagnostics Tracing (which you can read about here). I could try to write the Diagnostic Trace messages out to the ASP.NET Page Trace mechanism, but in MVC (which I\'m using), it doesn\'t really work. So, honestly my best bet is to write to a database (as writing to a file in the cloud is not very reliable) using a TraceListener class setup to redirect Trace messages to Log4net\'s log.\n\nMy TraceListener looked like this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Diagnostics\n\npublic class Log4netTraceListener : TraceListener\n{\n    private static readonly log4net.ILog _log;\n\n    public Log4netTraceListener()\n    {\n        _log = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(Log4netTraceListener));\n    }\n\n    public override void Write(string message)\n    {\n        if (_log != null)\n        {\n            _log.Debug(message);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public override void WriteLine(string message)\n    {\n        if (_log != null)\n        {\n            _log.Debug(message);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, I first tried adding my Log4netTraceListener in the web.config. However, this Listener is initialized and added to the "Trace.Listeners" collection before Log4net has initialized in my web application. So instead, I have to add it programmatically during the application startup. I did the following in my Global.asax.cs:\n\n```csharp\nSystem.Diagnostics.Trace.Listeners.Add(new Log4netTraceListener());\n```\n\nAfter all of that, I finally started seeing the following in my Log4net log:\n> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): Tables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and try again.\n\nWhoa, that is not something I expected to see. Apparently the "ELMAH_Error" table has a non-clustered primary key and no clustered index on the table (not really sure why). So we have two options:\n1. Add another column to the table and setup a clustered index on that column.\n2. The "Sequence" column is already an "int IDENTITY(1,1)" column - so just setup a clustered index on that column.\n\nI chose option 2. And here\'s the change to apply after executing the default [ELMAH SQL Script](https://code.google.com/p/elmah/source/browse/src/Elmah/SQLServer.sql):\n\n```sql\nCREATE CLUSTERED INDEX [IC_Elmah_Sequence] on dbo.[ELMAH_Error] (Sequence)\n```',

So, honestly my best bet is to write to a database (as writing to a file in the cloud is not very reliable) using a TraceListener class setup to redirect Trace messages to Log4net’s log.</p>\n<p>My TraceListener looked like this:</p>\n<figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> System.Diagnostics</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Log4netTraceListener</span> : <span class="title">TraceListener</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">readonly</span> log4net.ILog _log;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="title">Log4netTraceListener</span><span class="params">()</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _log = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(<span class="keyword">typeof</span>(Log4netTraceListener));</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Write</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">string</span> message)</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (_log != <span class="keyword">null</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            _log.Debug(message);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">WriteLine</span><span class="params">(<span class="keyword">string</span> message)</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (_log != <span class="keyword">null</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            _log.Debug(message);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Now, I first tried adding my Log4netTraceListener in the web.config.

        excerpt: '',
        more: '<p>Recently I was deploying an application to the new Azure Websites service, and I noticed a slight problem with my app.</p>\n<p>ELMAH worked on my machine, but not in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, if your exception logging isn’t working, then you’re probably not going to sleep well at night. So my first question, naturally, was “How in the world do I see what is going on inside ELMAH?”.</p>\n<p>One thing that many folks don’t realize until they need to do something like this is that logging libraries tend to “eat” many of their internal exceptions since they are usually the layer that is added to take care of exactly that. I say they “eat” their exceptions not in a strict sense, but more so because there really is no where you can do a “TRY CATCH” to see what is happening.</p>\n<h2 id="Tracing_to_the_Rescue">Tracing to the Rescue</h2><p>Instead of throwing exceptions both ELMAH and Log4net output their exceptions to the System.Diagnostics.Trace object. This is sweet when debugging locally, as any application traces will automatically write to the Output window in Visual Studio. But as the title of this post reads, that doesn’t help me at all.</p>\n<p>I needed to figure out how to output the traces of my app running in Azure to some storage that I could then view. I did have Log4net working, and it was writing to an SQL Azure database, so I decided to go with that option.</p>\n<p>First, I had to learn a few things about ASP.NET and Tracing.
